#MIPS simulator

Designed and created MIPS simulator from scratch - implemented 53 instructions. 
Unit testing used for each instruction and test cases to ensure functionality.

This project solidified my understanding of the flow through an Instruction Set Architecture processor, and increased my knowledge on the MIPS ISA.
